									<p>ArcGIS Arcade is Esri’s solution to more complex ArcGIS Online visualisations, interactions, and calculations. It is very similar in function to the calculation tool, however, it does not require that the user own or edit the data. With Arcade, users can customize pop-ups and change symbology of layers that are not hosted as a feature layer on your account, adding the ability to use data from the Living Atlas or other users. This is particularly helpful when data is automatically updated. Arcade’s interface is directly on the ArcGIS Online website, and includes many simple clickable features and tools - ideally making it accessible to users who are not well versed in code. That said, it is based off of Javascript and more complex coding is available in Arcade.</p>

									<p>Some specific uses that I found compelling were the ability to turn all caps data into proper case in pop-ups, add custom icons that are able to maintain the correct size at different scales, create pop-ups with characteristics from multiple layers, edits null values to say something more appealing (such as not available), and conduct spatial calculations without using credits such as intersect (particularly useful when an organization only has an ArcGIS Online license, such as the one I am working with for my internship. All together, I think that Arcade provides opportunities to be more collaborative with data on ArcGIS Online and removes some hassle and expense from hosting feature layers to make one small change. It is not surprising that Esri would implement a solution that encourages more use of data from Esri platforms, but it does make it convenient.
</p>
									<p>In addition to reviewing many articles about how to implement arcade, I completed a few tutorials. The first utilized a Living Atlas layer of world Ocean Temperatures (to monitor coral bleaching). This layer is continuously updated in Celsius. The task was to write an Arcade script to convert each temperature to Fahrenheit, which would then populate the legend and pop-ups with Fahrenheit values. A small bit of code placed in a new attribute box under symbology achieves this: $feature.sst * 1.8 + 32. </p>
